# üëã Hi, I'm Vijay Lande
I'm a Python Developer.

I specialize in Machine Learning, Backend Development, and Data Science. Currently, I‚Äôm deepening my expertise in advanced Python and diving into machine learning algorithms like SVM and Logistic Regression. I enjoy leveraging frameworks like Flask and Django to build robust web applications, while always staying curious about integrating AI-driven solutions into my projects.

During my internship at Brillect, I worked on various Python-related tasks and machine learning projects, which helped me develop both my technical abilities and problem-solving skills.

"I hold an MCA from G.H. Raisoni University and have a strong foundation in machine learning. I‚Äôm always seeking to expand my knowledge and apply it to real-world applications that make an impact. üöÄ"
